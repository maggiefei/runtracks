# runtracks
runtracks is a React Native iOS app that displays a list of songs for every BPM range. I made this app as a fun side project that would help me get through my tempo runs (running while listening to music of a certain BPM to keep your footfall cadence at that speed). The app is built using Firebase’s Realtime Database and Spotify’s Web API.
